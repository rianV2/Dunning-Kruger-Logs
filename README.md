# Dunning-Kruger-Logs
a cognitive bias that causes people to overestimate their knowledge or abilities

Data Structure
- HashTable = fast lookup, map in go, dict in python, where offer O(1)
- DoublyLinkedList = fast removal, fast insertion, use more memory need to store pointer of next and prev node
- LinkedList

Algorithm
- BFS - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZnyEApgFYg


Big O Notation
Time complexity
- focus on highest growth rate rather than exact execution counts
- O(NM) + O(M) = O(NM)
- if data result from O(NM), loop through data is same as O(NM), ignore constant factor, result to O(NM)
- The dominant term in Big-O notation is the largest one.
Space complexity
- init variable of loop O(n)
